##Henok Addis and Prashan Dharmasena
PROK is a 2D "bullet-hell shooter" game which was inspired by Touhou. It was created in Java with the use of Slick2D and LWJGL libraries. This was a senior year project for a software design class taught by Daniel Fowler. Was made thorugh sessions of peer-programming and individual programming.

#Gameplay
Essentially, the user is a single spaceship with one life and the user wants to defeat the boss at the top of the screen. For every time that the boss is defeated, the multiplier on the score of the user increases and they get a power-up which they can choose to collect. There are an unlimited number of bosses to defeat so the multiplier and power-ups are limitless.

There is a quick turn over after a death to the next game to encourage continuous gameplay.
